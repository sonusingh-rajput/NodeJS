# CLI vs GUI

CLI(command-line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) are two different ways of intrecting with a Computer or Software.

<h3>What is CLI</h3>
* Definations :- A text-based interface where users type commands to Perform Tasks.
* How it Works :- You interact with the system by typing specific commands into a terminal or console.

* Example:- Command Prompt in windows, Terminal in MacOS , Linux or YT-dlp

<h3>What is GUI</h3>

# What is Node.js ?

Node.js is a C++ application(CLI) which can understand and run javascript code outside of the Browser.It provides a runtime environment build on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine , enabling developers to execute javascript on the server side.

<h3>What is Node.js used for?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Web Servers and APIs</li>
    <li>Command-Line tools for example(npm,typeScript,Webpack,ESLint , Yarn,Create React App.Vue CLI , Angular CLI , Perttier, and more. )</li>
    <li>Internet of Things(IoT)</li>
</ul>

# Why do we need Node.js & How is it Different form js in Browser ?

Node.js is extends the capabilities of javascript beyound what is possible when running javascript solely in a browser environment . Here's what node.js can do the normal javascript cannot, which makes it sutiable for building Backends.

<h3>Access to File System</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Node.js : Provides APIs to interact with the file system,allowing you to read,write,delete and manupulate files and directories on the server.</li>
    <li>Normal JavaScript : In a Browser , javascript is sandboxed for security reasons, meaning it cannot directly access the file system of the client device. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Networking Capabilities</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Node.js : enables the creation of web servers , handles network requests, and supports low-laevel newtworking features line creatiing TCP/UDP servers , Handdling sockets, etc</li>
    <li>Normal JavaScript : In a Browser , javascript can make HTTP requests (via fetch or XMLHttpRequest),but it connot create servers or handle low-level networking tasks. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Process Management</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Node.js : Can spawn child processes , manage multiple threads,and handle system-level tasks like interacting with operating system processes</li>
    <li>Normal JavaScript : In a Browser , javascript is limited to running a single thread and cannot spawn processesor directly interact with othe operating system. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Interacting with Operating System</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Node.js : Can interact with the operating system to perform tasks like reading environment variables, interacting with system processes , scheduling tasks,etc</li>
    <li>Normal JavaScript : In a Browser , javascript is sandboxed and connot interact with the operating system directly , limiting its capabilities to brower related tasks. </li>
</ul>

# Terminal

always use Bash Terminal , In windows install bash 
<ol>
    <li>Install Download Git </li>
    <li>Then go to visual studio get Default Terminal to Bash.</li>
</lo> 

* Echo Command - .sh is the bash file (This command name is echo this is use for Display text , create a files , bebug and test etc)

* pwd - Show Curent Directory

* whoami - Current user name
